# Eliminate Noise with comb filter and Adaptive Line Enhancer
I attempted to eliminate the harmonic tone and white background noise in this recording (https://youtu.be/PB_8iOCm92c) with a combination of comb filter and adaptive line enhancer (ALE).

See the PDF "Eliminating Power Line Tone and Background Noise from an Audio Using Comb Filter and Adaptive Line Enhancer" for detailed description.

input: mbt_70_experimental_us_army_1970_360p.mp4

intermediate output: COMB_output_fo=134.8_bw =.97_best.mp4

final output: y(n)_ALE_output_M=64_mu=0.000010_L=3.m4a ( for download issues try y(n)_ALE_output_M=64_mu=0.000010_L=3.mp4)
