Eliminate Noise with Comb and ALE
I attempted to eliminate the harmonic tone and white background noise in this recording (https://youtu.be/PB_8iOCm92c) with a combination of comb filter and adaptive line enhancer (ALE).

See the PDF "Using Comb Filter and Adaptive Line Enhancer to Enhance the Audio Quality of a Recording" for detailed description.
